dEVEOre - An EVE-Online Ore Mining Tool
=======

A common question amongst miners in the world of EVE is: should I refine the ore I just mined or should I sell it raw?

dEVEOre helps you answer this question by fetching Ore/Mineral buy orders - in the system where you want to sell - from EVE API. It gives you info like income per hour for a specific ore when selling it raw or refined.

See the wiki for more information.
